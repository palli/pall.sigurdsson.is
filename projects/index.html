            <h2>Pynag</h2>
            <p>
                Pynag is a python library intended to easy the lives of developers working with the Nagios Monitoring

                Pynag also has modules to help making Nagios plugins, including formatting of performance
                data and threshold range calculations. As of late it also has Status related information for example

            <h2>Adagios</h2>
            <p>
                Adagios is a web configuration interface for nagios and a replacement for the legacy web interface. It
                has been my pet project for quite some time now and been my learning curve for html5 and javascript
                development.
            </p>
            <h2>TSM Status Monitor</h2>
