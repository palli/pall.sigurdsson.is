title: Gopro Hero 3 Black with Macro Filters
---
<p>
So, lately i have been playing around with Macro filters on Gopro's latest and greatest action camera. While the camera
itself works great, it does is not designed for the close-up macro required to film underwater nudibranches.

I found multiple posts on scubaboard forums from a guy named Marty Cervin who seems to be the de facto expert when it
comes to gopro+macrofilters+underwater videos.
Read <a href="http://www.scubaboard.com/forums/gopro-video/415267-gopro-blurfix-55mm-adapter-macro-lens-filters-questions.html">this</a> and <a href="http://goprouser.freeforums.org/viewtopic.php?t=10017&p=56810">this</a> post to get you started and dont forget to check out some of the <a href="https://vimeo.com/user5071885">videos mentioned</a>.
</p>
<p>

In short my setup is as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Blurfix Slip-on adapter from <a href="http://snakeriverprototyping.com">Snake River Prototyping</a></li>
    <li>55mm macro filter or a close-up kit (i bought generic 10+4+2+1 close-up kit from amazon)</li>
    <li>Camera mode 1080p 30fps with medium field of view is my favorite mode while underwater</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>

The filters snap on outside the dive housing so the filters get wet. For this reason it is best to assemble them
underwater otherwise you risk having air bubbles in between the filters underwater.

While underwater the camera becomes a little near-sighted and instead of having minimum distance of 1 meter, minimum distance
now roughly 10-15 cm. Perfect for shooting nudibranches.
