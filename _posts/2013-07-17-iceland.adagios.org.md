title: Monitoring the health of Iceland
---
<p>I have a new project going on right now.. Monitoring everything in Icelandic society with Adagios. Check it out at <a href="http://iceland.adagios.org">http://iceland.adagios.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
Currently we are monitoring most DNS and web servers we know in Iceland and to make things a little more interesting we monitor we non-technical metrics like:
  <ul>
  <li>Is there storm warning ?</li>
  <li>Are there any earthquakes going on ?</li>
  <li>How Many patients are in the emergency room ?</li>
  <li>Are public transportation like buses and airplanes running ?</li>
  <li>Is the local currency stable</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
There are lots of cool ideas that can be integrated in the project. Sadly all my time is occupied with improving the business intelligence module in Adagios, so that the site runs smoothly and reliably.
